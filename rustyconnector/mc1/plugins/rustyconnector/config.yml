#
# The address used to connect to this server.
# This address should match what a player would enter if they were trying to connect directly to this server.
# Make sure you also include the port number!
#
# If you're in a Kubernetes or Docker environment, you can bypass this option by setting the RC_ADDRESS environment variable.
#
# Example: 127.0.0.1:25565
#
address: "minecraft1:25565"

#
# The family to register this server to.
# Every server must be a member of a family.
# If the server tries to register into a family that doesn't exist, the server won't register.
#
family: "dev1"

magic-link:
    #
    # The address for the Magic Link access point.
    # It's not necessary to provide a slash at the end.
    #
    # Example: http://127.0.0.1:8080
    #
    access-endpoint: "http://velocity:8080"

#
# Should this server us a UUID for it's serverID instead of the family name + nano id?
# This setting is really only necessary if you're in highly scalable environments and have
# the infrastructure to properly handle UUIDs as server names.
#
# Enabling this setting is the same as setting this server's name in velocity.toml to a UUID.
# Certain plugins aren't written to deal with server names that long and you'll have to implement
# proper API support to display something other than server UUIDs to players.
#
# If you enable this, you'll need to delete `metadata/server.id` so that it can be regenerated with the new uuid.
#
use-uuid: false

#
# Provide additional metadata for the server
# Metadata provided here is non-essential, meaning that RustyConnector is capable of running without anything provided here.
# When you provide metadata here it will be sent to the proxy. Ensure that the provided metadata conforms to valid JSON syntax.
#
# For built-in metadata options, check the Aelysium wiki:
# https://wiki.aelysium.group/rusty-connector/docs/concepts/metadata/
#
metadata: "{\"softCap\": 30, \"hardCap\": 40}"
